## 🚗 Standard Maintenance Intervals

### Engine & Fluids

| Maintenance Type | Recommended Interval | Our App Value | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Oil Change** | 5,000-15,000 km or 6-12 months | 10,000 km | ✅ Optimal |
| **Coolant Flush** | 40,000 km or 2 years | 40,000 km | ✅ Correct |
| **Transmission Fluid** | 60,000-100,000 km | 60,000 km | ✅ Conservative (safe) |

**Notes:**
- Oil change intervals vary by oil type (synthetic lasts longer)
- Always check manufacturer recommendations
- Severe conditions require more frequent changes

### Filters

| Maintenance Type | Recommended Interval | Our App Value | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Air Filter** | 10,000-20,000 km or 12 months | 15,000 km | ✅ Mid-range |
| **Cabin Filter** | 10,000-15,000 km or 12 months | 15,000 km | ✅ Correct |

**Notes:**
- Dusty environments require more frequent replacement
- Check visually if airflow seems restricted

### Brakes

| Maintenance Type | Recommended Interval | Our App Value | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Brake Inspection** | 20,000 km | 20,000 km | ✅ Industry Standard |
| **Brake Pads** | 40,000-60,000 km | 50,000 km | ✅ Realistic Average |
| **Brake Fluid** | 2 years or 40,000 km | N/A | 📝 Future Feature |

**Notes:**
- Brake pad life varies greatly by driving style
- City driving wears brakes faster
- Inspect if you hear squealing or reduced performance

### Tires

| Maintenance Type | Recommended Interval | Our App Value | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tire Rotation** | 10,000 km | 10,000 km | ✅ Industry Standard |
| **Tire Replacement** | 40,000-80,000 km | 50,000 km | ✅ Good Average |
| **Wheel Alignment** | 20,000 km or as needed | 20,000 km | ✅ Correct |
| **Wheel Balancing** | 20,000 km or as needed | 20,000 km | ✅ Correct |

**Notes:**
- Check tire pressure monthly
- Replace when tread depth < 1.6mm
- Alignment after hitting potholes or curbs

### Electrical

| Maintenance Type | Recommended Interval | Our App Value | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Battery Replacement** | 3-5 years | 3 years (1095 days) | ✅ Conservative (safe) |
| **Spark Plugs** | 30,000-50,000 km | 40,000 km | ✅ Mid-range |

**Notes:**
- Battery life depends on climate (hot climates reduce life)
- Modern cars may last 5+ years
- Platinum/iridium plugs last longer than copper

### Legal & Administrative

| Maintenance Type | Recommended Interval | Our App Value | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Annual Inspection** | 12 months (legal requirement) | 365 days | ✅ Legal Compliance |
| **Registration Renewal** | 12 months (legal requirement) | 365 days | ✅ Legal Compliance |
